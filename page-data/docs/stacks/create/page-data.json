For example, the <a href=\"https://github.com/appsody/stacks/tree/master/incubator/nodejs-express/image\"><code>nodejs-express</code></a> stack image provides health endpoints and prometheus metrics without developers needing to implement it themselves.</p>\n<p>The <code>/image</code> directory will contain everything that is needed for the stack's image. You <strong>must</strong> include a <code>Dockerfile-stack</code> file in the <code>/image</code> directory, which defines how the stack image is built.</p>\n<p>Stack creators configure <a href=\"/docs/stacks/environment-variables\">environment variables</a> in <code>Dockerfile-stack</code> to specify the behaviour they expect from the stack throughout the application development lifecycle. <code>Appsody CLI</code> and <code>Appsody controller</code> inspect these environment variables and then drive the expected behaviour for the developer.</p>\n<p>If a stack image is built upon another stack's image, it will inherit all the Appsody variables from the base stack. It can override the variables it wants to change. This allows users to create stacks with slightly different behaviour while still getting updates from the base stack.</p>\n<p>The <code>/image/project</code> directory contains the base of the application. You may decide not to include any application code here but it is recommended to add some value to the stack. For example, by controlling dependency versions. The <code>project</code> <strong>must</strong> include a production <code>Dockerfile</code> here which will be used by the <a href=\"/docs/using-appsody/cli-commands/#appsody-build\"><code>appsody build</code></a> command.</p>\n<h2>Creating a template</h2>\n<p>Templates provide an initial application to enable developers to get started with a stack. They provide a starter application that a developer can expand and adapt as they require.</p>\n<p>All templates should be created within <code>/templates</code>. Every template is contained within its own directory, <code>/templates/&#x3C;template-name></code>.</p>\n<p>If the stack is intended to be contributed to the  <a href=\"https://github.com/appsody/stacks\">Appsody stacks repository</a> the stack image should be called <code>appsody/&#x3C;stack-name>:&#x3C;stack-version></code>.</p>\n<h2>Building and testing stacks locally</h2>\n<p>Now that have you have created a stack you can <a href=\"/docs/stacks/build-and-test\">build and test</a> it locally.</p>\n<h2>Contributing a stack</h2>\n<p>If you would like to contribute a new stack to the <a href=\"https://github.com/appsody/stacks\">stacks repository</a> the Appsody <a href=\"https://github.com/appsody/website/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\">contributing guildlines</a> explains how.</p>\n<p>We welcome new contributions but before starting a large piece of work we recommend to reach out to us on <a href=\"http://appsody-slack.eu-gb.mybluemix.net/\">slack</a> or <a href=\"https://github.com/appsody/stacks/issues/\">raise an issue</a> to start a discussion.</p>\n<h2>Maintaining a separate repository</h2>\n<p>In addition to the main Appsody stacks repository, you can maintain your own set of stacks. This is useful for developing stacks and separating sets of stacks for different uses.</p>\n<p>By default you have access to the <code>appsodyhub</code> repository:</p>\n<pre><code>$ appsody repo list\nNAME            URL                                                               \n*appsodyhub     https://github.com/appsody/stacks/releases/latest/download/incubator-index.yaml  \nexperimental    https://github.com/appsody/stacks/releases/latest/download/experimental-index.yaml\n</code></pre>\n<p>A repository is defined by an <code>index.yaml</code>. This file lists all stacks and  templates it wants to make avalible.  See the <code>appsodyhub</code> <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/appsody/stacks/master/index.yaml\">index</a> as an example.</p>\n<p>Each template section must include a link to its <code>.tar.gz</code> file. This will be used by <code>appsody init</code> to initialize a Appsody project.</p>\n<p>You can add you repository by running:</p>\n<pre><code>appsody repo add &#x3C;name> &#x3C;index-url>\n</code></pre>\n<p>For example:</p>\n<pre><code>appsody repo add my-repo file:///Users/foo/index.yaml\n\nappsody repo list\nNAME           URL                                                               \n*appsodyhub    https://github.com/appsody/stacks/releases/latest/download/incubator-index.yaml\nexperimental   https://github.com/appsody/stacks/releases/latest/download/experimental-index.yaml\nmy-repo        file:///Users/foo/index.yaml\n</code></pre>\n<p>Once the repository has been added you can access the stacks in that repo by specifying the repository name when initializing your project:</p>\n<pre><code>appsody init my-repo/&#x3C;stack-name>\n</code></pre>","frontmatter":{"path":"/docs/stacks/create"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"layout":"docs"}}}
