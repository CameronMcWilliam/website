In this case, you can use <code>appsody deploy --generate-only</code> to generate a deployment manifest, which you can then push to your repo.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These deployment options are covered in more detail in the following sections.</p>\n<h2>Building your runtime Docker image with Appsody</h2>\n<p>When you use the Appsody CLI to develop your applications, a <em>development</em> Docker image of the target runtime is downloaded and run for you. This image differs slightly from the image that is used at deployment time, because it configures tools that are useful only during the development phase.</p>\n<p>If you want to generate a <em>deployment</em> Docker image , use the <code>appsody build</code> command.</p>\n<p>The <code>appsody build</code> command completes the following actions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Extracts your code and other artifacts, including a new Dockerfile, which are required to build the <em>deployment</em> image from the <em>development</em> image. These files are saved to the <code>~/.appsody/extract</code> directory.</li>\n<li>Runs a <code>docker build</code> against the Dockerfile that was extracted on the previous step to produce a <em>deployment</em> image in your local Docker registry. If you want to give the image a name, specify the <code>-t &#x3C;tag></code> parameter. If you run <code>appsody build</code> with no parameters, the image is given a name that matches the name of your project.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> If your project includes uppercase characters these are converted to lowercase characters in the image name because Docker does not accept uppercase characters in image tags. Also, if your project directory includes underscore characters, those will be converted to dashes (-), because certain areas of Kubernetes are not tolerant of underscore characters.</p>\n<p>Here is an example of the output produced by the <code>appsody build</code> command on a project named <code>appsody-project</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>micheles-mbp:appsody-project mchilant$ appsody build\nExtracting project from development environment\nRunning command: docker[pull appsody/nodejs:0.2]\nRunning command: docker[run --rm --name appsody-project-extract --entrypoint /bin/bash appsody/nodejs:0.2 -c if [ -f /project/Dockerfile ]; then echo \"/project/Dockerfile\"; else find / -type f -name Dockerfile; fi]\nRunning command: docker[create --name appsody-project-extract -v /Users/mchilant/appsody-project/:/project/user-app appsody/nodejs:0.2]\nRunning command: docker[cp appsody-project-extract:/project /Users/mchilant/.appsody/extract/appsody-project]\nRunning command: docker[rm appsody-project-extract -f]\nProject extracted to /Users/mchilant/.appsody/extract/appsody-project\nRunning command: docker[build -t appsody-project -f /Users/mchilant/.appsody/extract/appsody-project/Dockerfile /Users/mchilant/.appsody/extract/appsody-project]\nBuilt docker image appsody-project\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Deploying your app directly to a Kubernetes cluster</h2>\n<p>There are many options to deploy your Appsody applications to a Kubernetes cluster. The best approach depends on the specific scenario:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you are testing your app on a locally installed cluster, using <code>appsody deploy</code> is your best bet</li>\n<li>If you intend to have your app deployed on a shared cluster for integration testing or production, you are probably going to rely on CI/CD pipelines, and have the app built and deployed from its source.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The <code>appsody deploy</code> command provides a way for you to deploy your application directly to a Kubernetes cluster. The deployment may occur in one of two different ways, depending on how the stack you are using is configured:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If the stack contains a deployment manifest that can be consumed by the <a href=\"https://operatorhub.io/operator/appsody-operator\">Appsody operator</a>, <code>appsody deploy</code> will install the operator, if necessary, and deploy your application to the cluster using that deployment manifest.</li>\n<li>If the stack you are using is not equipped with the manifest for the Appsody operator, <code>appsody deploy</code> attempts to install your app as a Knative serving service.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Deployment via the Appsody Operator - Overview</h3>\n<p>Kubernetes operators offer a powerful way to provide full lifecycle maintenance of a wide range of resources on Kubernetes clusters. In particular, they can install, upgrade, remove, and monitor application deployments. The recently published <a href=\"https://operatorhub.io/operator/appsody-operator\">Appsody operator</a> automates the installation and maintenance of a special type of Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs), called <strong>AppsodyApplication</strong>. </p>\n<p>The Appsody stacks that are currently available include a template of such a CRD manifest. When you run <code>appsody deploy</code> on a project created from one of the stacks enabled with those manifests, the CLI customizes the manifest with information that is specific to the deployment (such as namespace and project name), and submits the manifest to the Appsody operator on the Kubernetes cluster.</p>\n<p>In fact, if your cluster does not already provide an operator, <code>appsody deploy</code> will install one for you. You can also use the Appsody CLI to install an instance of the Appsody operator, without installing any applications. This can be achieved by running the <code>appsody operator install</code> command.\nLet's discuss some of the details behind the <code>appsody deploy</code> and <code>appsody operator</code> commands. </p>\n<h4>How the Appsody operator works</h4>\n<p>Before we delve into the details of <code>appsody deploy</code> and <code>appsody operator</code>, we need to spend a few words on how the Appsody operator works.</p>\n<p>An operator monitors certain resources - it can detect when resource definition instances are added, removed, or changed, and take the appropriate action. </p>\n<p>The Appsody operator monitors instances of the <strong>AppsodyApplication</strong> resource. It does so by \"watching\" a certain namespace, which is defined when the Appsody operator is installed. The operator can watch a single namespace, or all the namespaces in the cluster.</p>\n<p>The operator itself, however, can be installed in its own namespace, which not necessarily coincides with the namespace it is watching. You can have an Appsody operator in namespace \"abc\" watching namespace \"xyz\". </p>\n<p>You can also have multiple Appsody operators in a cluster, but only one operator can watch a certain namespace. Also, only one operator can be installed in any given namespace.</p>\n<p>Lastly, if you have an Appsody operator that watches the entire cluster, that can be the only Appsody operator in the cluster.</p>\n<h4>Using <code>appsody deploy</code> with the Appsody operator</h4>\n<p>When you run <code>appsody deploy</code> on a project that is based on a stack that is enabled for the Appsody operator, this command will do the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It will check whether there is an Appsody operator in the target namespace that watches that same namespace</li>\n<li>If there isn't one, it attempts to install it. If there's already an operator, the command will move to the next step.</li>\n<li>The command will then proceed to install the AppsodyApplication (your app)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The command can be run with or without a <code>--namespace</code> or <code>-n</code> flag. No flag means you are targeting the <code>default</code> namespace.</p>\n<p>When you want to remove your application, you can run: </p>\n<pre><code>appsody deploy delete\n</code></pre>\n<p>This command must be run from your Appsody project directory. It will attempt to remove the application you installed, but it will not touch the Appsody operator.</p>\n<h4>Using the <code>appsody operator</code> commands</h4>\n<p>In certain cases, you may want to deploy one or more Appsody operators on your cluster ahead of time, and let developers deploy their applications to the cluster without them having to meddle with operator deployments.</p>\n<p>The <code>appsody operator</code> commands can be used to install or uninstall those operators. They take this form:</p>\n<pre><code>appsody operator install --namespace &#x3C;operator namespace> --watchspace &#x3C;watched namespace>\nappsody operator uninstall --namespace &#x3C;operator namespace>\n</code></pre>\n<p>The first command attempts to install an Appsody operator in <code>operator namespace</code>, watching the <code>watched namespace</code>. If the <code>--watchspace</code> flag is omitted, the watched namespace will default to the operator namespace. If both flags are omitted, both namespaces will be assumed to be the <code>default</code> namespace.</p>\n<p>The second command attempts to remove the Appsody operator installed in the <code>operator namespace</code>, if there is one. When you run that command, the Appsody CLI will check whether there are Appsody applications that are present in the watched namespace associated with that operator. If there are any, the command will take no action and produce a message that suggests using the <code>--force</code> flag to force the removal of the apps, as shown below:</p>\n<pre><code>appsody operator uninstall --namespace &#x3C;operator namespace> --force\n</code></pre>\n<p>You can also install an Appsody operator that watches the entire cluster, using the following command:</p>\n<pre><code>appsody operator install --namespace &#x3C;operator namespace> --watch-all\n</code></pre>\n<h4>RBAC considerations for the use of <code>appsody deploy</code> and <code>appsody operator</code> commands</h4>\n<p>The <code>appsody deploy</code> and <code>appsody operator</code> commands involve the lookup and creation of a number of different resources, both in specific namespaces and at the cluster level. </p>\n<p>In a typical local testing scenario, developers have full administrative rights on the entire cluster. In that case, no specific provisions need to be made in terms of granting permissions.</p>\n<p>However, if a single cluster is shared across many development groups, it is common practice to restrict full access to resources by limiting it to a single namespace. An individual developer or a group of developers would have the ability to create, modify, and delete resources only in a certain namespace. </p>\n<p>The use of <code>appsody deploy</code> and <code>appsody operator</code> commands, however, requires granting the following permissions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Querying Appsody operator instances across namespaces</li>\n<li>Creating the <code>AppsodyApplication</code> CRDs</li>\n<li>Querying <code>RoleBindings</code> across namespaces</li>\n<li>Creating instances of the Appsody operator in a namespace</li>\n<li>Full access to resources in the watched namespace of the operator, if different from the namespace where the operator is installed</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In a shared cluster scenario, with developers limited to access their own namespace, we expect the most common pattern of usage will be the following:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Developers can use <code>appsody deploy -n &#x3C;namespace></code> to target their own namespace. The first time <code>appsody deploy</code> is used, the operator is installed and it watches the namespace of choice.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Only cluster administrators can use <code>appsody operator install -n &#x3C;namespace> --watchspace &#x3C;another namespace></code> to enable operators to watch across namespaces. </p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Under these assumptions, developers need to be granted the following permissions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>First, through a Role: </li>\n</ol>\n<pre><code>kind: Role\napiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1\nmetadata:\n  name: $NAMESPACE-user-full-access\n  namespace: $NAMESPACE\nrules:\n- apiGroups: [\"\", \"extensions\", \"apps\", \"autoscaling\", \"appsody.dev\", \"rbac.authorization.k8s.io\"]\n  resources: [\"*\"]\n  verbs: [\"*\"]\n- apiGroups: [\"batch\"]\n  resources:\n  - jobs\n  - cronjobs\n  verbs: [\"*\"]\n</code></pre>\n<p>This role grants full access to resources in a certain namespace (substitute the <code>$NAMESPACE</code> placeholder with the namespace name), including the Appsody operator resources.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Second, through a ClusterRole:</li>\n</ol>\n<pre><code>kind: ClusterRole\napiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1\nmetadata:\n  name: $NAMESPACE-user-node-readonly-access\nrules:\n- apiGroups: [\"\", \"apps\", \"autoscaling\", \"extensions\"]\n  resources: [\"*\"]\n  verbs: [\"get\", \"watch\", \"list\"]\n- apiGroups: [\"apiextensions.k8s.io\"]\n  resources: [\"customresourcedefinitions\"]\n  verbs: [\"*\"]\n- apiGroups: [\"rbac.authorization.k8s.io\"]\n  resources: [\"rolebindings\"]\n  verbs: [\"get\", \"watch\", \"list\"]  \n</code></pre>\n<p>  This ClusterRole allows users to lookup the necessary resources across namespaces, and to create CRDs anywhere in the cluster (which is required by the installation of the operator, in certain cases).</p>\n<p>  Once you have these roles in place, you need to create the appropriate RoleBinding and ClusterRoleBinding to bind your users or groups to them.</p>\n<h3>Deployment as a Knative Service</h3>\n<p>If the stack you are using for your Appsody project does not support the Appsody operator, <code>appsody deploy</code> will default to deploying your app as a Knative serving service.</p>\n<p>In this case, the following <strong>pre-requisites</strong> apply:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You must have access to a Kubernetes cluster, with Knative Serving installed and running. To install Knative locally, use the Kubernetes feature in Docker for Desktop, see <a href=\"/content/docs/using-appsody/installing-knative-locally.md\">Installing Knative Locally</a>. To install Knative on other Kubernetes clusters, see the <a href=\"https://knative.dev/docs/install/\">Knative Install Documentation</a>.</li>\n<li>You must configure your <code>kubectl</code> CLI to point to your Kubernetes cluster.</li>\n<li>If you intend to push the Docker image containing your application to Docker Hub, your target cluster must be configured to pull images from Docker Hub.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Using the createKnativeService option to deploy as a Knative Service</h4>\n<p>The appsody operator allows you to deploy as a Knative Service if your stack contains a config/app-deploy.yaml file. You can add the element <code>createKnativeService: true</code> to your <code>app-deploy.yaml</code> file in your project directory.</p>\n<p>Perform the following steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><code>appsody deploy --generate-only</code> will create <code>app-deploy.yaml</code> for your project</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Edit your app-deploy.yaml file.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Add the line <code>createKnativeService: true</code> in the spec definition section to the <code>app-deploy.yaml</code> file created above.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Deploy your application:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>For Local Docker:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Run the command <code>appsody deploy —-tag dev.local/&#x3C;projectName> --namespace your-namespace</code></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Tagging with  <code>dev.local/</code> makes the image accessible to your Kubernetes cluster.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>For Docker Hub:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Run the command <code>appsody deploy --push --tag my-account/&#x3C;projectName> --namespace your-namespace</code>\nNotes:</li>\n<li>The --tag option tags the image.</li>\n<li>You must be logged in to your docker repo for --push to work. </li>\n<li>The --push  flag tells the appsody CLI to push the image to Docker Hub</li>\n<li>You must be logged in to Docker Hub for --push to work. </li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The Knative Service should now be operable at the URL specified in the output.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Deploying your application to a local Kubernetes cluster</h3>\n<p>If you have installed a Kubernetes cluster on your development workstation and want to use your local Docker image cache instead of pushing the image to Docker Hub, make sure you set up your Kubernetes cluster to consume images from the local Docker cache.</p>\n<p>To deploy your Appsody project locally, run:</p>\n<pre><code>appsody deploy\n</code></pre>\n<p>This command completes the following actions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Calls <code>appsody build</code> and creates a <em>deployment</em> Docker image, as described in the previous section.</li>\n<li>Tags the image with the special prefix <code>dev.local</code>, making it accessible to your Kubernetes cluster.</li>\n<li>Creates a deployment manifest file named <code>app-deploy.yaml</code>, in a <code>/deploy</code> subdirectory of the project directory. This yaml file is used to issue a <code>kubectl apply -f</code> command against the target Kubernetes cluster. The format of this yaml file depends on whether or not the stack you are using is enabled for the Appsody operator.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Deploying your application through Docker Hub</h3>\n<p>If your cluster is configured to pull images from Docker Hub, use the following command to deploy your application:</p>\n<pre><code>appsody deploy -t &#x3C;myaccount/appsody-project> --push --namespace mynamespace\n</code></pre>\n<p>The command completes the following actions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Calls <code>appsody build</code> and creates a deployment image, as described in the previous section.</li>\n<li>The <code>-t myaccount/appsody-project</code> option tags the image.</li>\n<li>The <code>--push</code> flag tells the appsody CLI to push the image to Docker Hub.</li>\n<li>Creates a deployment manifest file named <code>app-deploy.yaml</code>, in a <code>/deploy</code> subdirectory of the project directory. This yaml file is used to issue a <code>kubectl apply -f</code> command against the target Kubernetes cluster. The format of this yaml file depends on whether or not the stack you are using is enabled for the Appsody operator.</li>\n<li>The <code>--namespace mynamespace</code> option provisions the deployment under the <code>mynamespace</code> namespace.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you don't specify <code>--push</code>, the image is available only on your local Docker registry and the target Kubernetes cluster must be configured to have access to your local Docker registry. Additionally, your image will be tagged as  <code>dev.local/&#x3C;project-name></code> and referenced in the deployment manifest.</p>\n<h3>Deploying multiple projects</h3>\n<p>If you are running multiple Appsody projects on your workstation, you can use <code>appsody deploy</code> and <code>appsody operator</code> commands to get them deployed to a Kubernetes cluster. However, make sure that you run these commands one at a time, because those commands create temporary files that might lead to conflicts if created concurrently.</p>\n<h2>Deploying your app through a Tekton pipeline</h2>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> This deployment option is under development</p>\n<p>Most likely, the deployment of apps created with the appsody CLI is going to occur through the invocation of a CI/CD build pipeline.</p>\n<p>As a developer, you develop your app using the appsody CLI, and when you are ready to deploy, you push your code to a repo or create a pull request on GitHub.</p>\n<p>This <a href=\"https://github.com/appsody/tekton-example\">example</a> shows you how to use Tekton pipelines to deploy your app as a Knative Serving service to a Kubernetes cluster.</p>\n<p>The following pre-requisites are required to run the example pipeline:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You must have developed a project with the appsody CLI, and you must have checked your project into a GitHub repository.</li>\n<li>Your Kubernetes cluster must be configured to run Tekton pipelines (see <a href=\"https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/blob/master/docs/install.md\">Installing Tekton Pipelines</a>).</li>\n<li>Your project must include a deployment manifest called <code>app-deploy.yaml</code>, which is a current pre-requisite if you want to run the pipeline with minimal changes. A quick way to obtain such a manifest is to run the <code>appsody deploy --generate-only</code> command, and then check the <code>app-deploy.yaml</code> file into your source code repository.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>More details on running the Tekton pipeline example for Appsody can be found in the repo <a href=\"https://github.com/appsody/tekton-example/blob/master/README.md\">readme file</a></p>","frontmatter":{"path":"/docs/using-appsody/building-and-deploying"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"layout":"docs"}}}
