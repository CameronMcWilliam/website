# Stack development with Git Clone

## Create your own stack
To create a new stack using Git, clone the sample stack in the stacks repository. Use this command:

```
git clone https://github.com/appsody/stacks.git
cd stacks/samples/sample-stack
```
## Modify an existing stack
To modify an existing stack using Git, clone your chosen stack in the stacks repository. For example, to create a new stack, called my-stack, based on the Node.js Express stack use this command:

```
git clone https://github.com/appsody/stacks.git
cd stacks/incubator/nodejs-express
```
