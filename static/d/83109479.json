Here you will find a list of common questions and answers along with CLI issues you may face.</p>\n<h2>CLI Issues</h2>\n<h3>1. Does Appsody support Enterprise Windows users?</h3>\n<p>Enterprise Windows users very frequently authenticate through Azure Active Directory (AAD). In those circumstances, the Docker daemon on Windows may not be authorized to access any of the folders that are owned by the AAD user. For this reason, Appsody supports Enterprise Windows users through a workaround.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Create a new project (pick a folder that is outside of your home directory, or Docker will not have access to it).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Go into that project directory and run <code>appsody init &#x3C;stack></code></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Create a new folder called <code>C:\\my-appsody-config-dir\\</code></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Run <code>appsody init --config C:\\my-appsody-config-dir\\.appsody-config.yaml</code></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><code>notepad C:\\my-appsody-config-dir\\.appsody-config.yaml</code></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Change the entry <code>home:</code> to <code>C:\\my-appsody-config-dir</code></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Run <code>appsody run --config C:\\my-appsody-config-dir\\.appsody-config.yaml</code></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For more information on this issue, click <a href=\"https://github.com/appsody/appsody/issues/24\">here</a>.</p>\n<h3>2. Why am I getting a cross-device link error on Appsody extract?</h3>\n<p>This was an issue that was faced in an older version of the software. It occurred when the Appsody CLI and the Appsody project were located on different disk volumes. If you are experiencing this problem, navigate to our <a href=\"https://github.com/appsody\">GitHub page</a> and ensure you are operating on the latest version. If you would like more information on this issue, please click <a href=\"https://github.com/appsody/appsody/issues/82\">here</a>.\n</p>\n<h3>3. Why is Appsody deploy not displaying the URL of the Knative service?</h3>\n<p>Sometimes, when you run <code>appsody deploy</code>, you may see a message that fails to provide the URL of the deployed Knative service. Although the Knative URL is not displaying, Appsody should have still been deployed successfully. This is a timing issue where <code>kubectl apply</code> finishes executing before all resources have been made available.</p>\n<h3>4. Is the HTTP_PROXY environment variable used by the CLI?</h3>\n<p>Versions of Appsody at 0.2.5 and older do not support going through a HTTP proxy. However, newer versions do: Before launching Appsody, you just need to set the HTTP_PROXY or HTTPS_PROXY environment variable.</p>\n<h3>5. Why can't the CLI read my index?</h3>\n<p>When you encounter the following error</p>\n<pre><code>[Error] Could not read indices: Failed to get repository index: 404 Not Found response trying to download https://raw.githubusercontent.com/appsody/stacks/master/index.yaml\n</code></pre>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Go to your home directory and open the <strong>repository.yaml</strong> using an editor of your choice.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>cd ~/.appsody/repository/</code> (macOS/Linux)</li>\n<li><code>cd %HOMEPATH%/.appsody/repository/</code> (Windows)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Replace the appsodyhub URL to use the latest appsodyhub index which is:</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><code>https://github.com/appsody/stacks/releases/latest/download/incubator-index.yaml</code></p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Save your changes and try running your command again.</li>\n</ol>","frontmatter":{"path":"/docs/faq","title":"FAQ"}}},{"node":{"html":"<h1>Welcome to Appsody</h1>\n<p>Appsody is designed to help you develop containerized applications for the cloud.</p>\n<p>If you're a software developer, our aim is to greatly improve your developer experience by removing the burden of managing the full software development stack. With Appsody,\nyou can build applications for the cloud that are ready to be deployed to Kubernetes without being an expert on the underlying container technology. You can simply focus on the important stuff - developing application code!  </p>\n<p>If you're responsible for defining standards for application runtime environments such as software levels, Appsody allows you to control the stacks that your developers use. You can define a set of technologies that are configurable, reusable, and already infused with cloud native capabilities. You get to implement and maintain your standards, ensuring consistency and reliability.</p>\n<p>Appsody consists of 3 key components:</p>\n<h3>Appsody Stacks</h3>\n<p>These are configurable technology stacks built with popular runtimes and frameworks, such as <em>Java with Eclipse MicroProfile</em> and <em>Node.js with Express</em>. These stacks  provide the foundation for building applications that can be deployed and managed effectively in Kubernetes. Stacks allow for rapid development, whilst giving the stack provider the ability to control how the applications are composed. For example, which security policies are applied or which version of a dependency is used. For more\ninformation, see <a href=\"/docs/stacks/stacks-overview.md\">Appsody Stacks</a>.</p>\n<h3>Appsody Hub</h3>\n<p>The Hub is the central point of control for Appsody Stacks where you can find available stacks, create new stacks, or modify existing ones. You can use the Hub content in the public repo or clone it to provide a private Hub that's based on your requirements. By making changes to the Stacks in the Hub, you can deploy updates to any application that's been built on them, simply by restarting the application.</p>\n<h3>Appsody CLI</h3>\n<p>No project is complete without a nice new CLI to play with. The <a href=\"/docs/using-appsody/cli-commands.md\">Appsody CLI</a> is powerful and intuitive, allowing developers to discover the available stacks and bring them into their local development environment. From here, they can build, run, test, and deploy applications locally. The Docker container that's built for an application can then be integrated with Tekton pipelines and deployed to Kubernetes cloud environments. For more information, see <a href=\"/docs/using-appsody/building-and-deploying.md#Deploying-your-app-through-a-Tekton-pipeline\">Deploying your app through a Tekton pipeline</a>.</p>\n<h2>How does it work?</h2>\n<p>Appsody provides pre-configured application stacks, which use the well-known Dockerfile syntax to specify which language runtimes, frameworks, libraries, and tools are included. Project templates build upon these stacks, providing developers with a templatized application to bring into their IDE of choice and begin development.</p>\n<p>When developers run, debug, or test their application using the Appsody CLI, it starts a container with the stack image, makes the development workspace available to the running container, and starts the Appsody controller. The controller is configurable through environment variables in the stack and manages the application within the running container. For example, the controller can watch for changes in the application <code>/src</code> directory. When these changes are saved, the controller restarts the application running in a docker container.</p>\n<h2>Contributing</h2>\n<p>We welcome all contributions.</p>\n<p>If you'd like to get involved, read our <a href=\"https://github.com/appsody/website/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\">Contribution guidelines</a> and come and chat to us in <a href=\"https://appsody-slack.eu-gb.mybluemix.net/\">Slack</a>.</p>\n<p>Want to see your framework available as an Appsody Stack?

Each contributed stack should include a LICENSE file containing the Apache 2.0 license. More information can be found in the LICENSE file or online at</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\">http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0</a></p>","frontmatter":{"path":"/docs","title":"Appsody Overview"}}},{"node":{"html":"<h1>Creating a Stack</h1>\n<p>A stack is made up of two main components, the stack image and templates that\nuse the stack's image.</p>\n<h2>Getting started</h2>\n<p>The quickest way to get started creating a new stack is to use the <a href=\"https://github.com/appsody/stacks/tree/master/samples/sample-stack\">sample stack</a>.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Clone the stacks repository:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">git clone https://github.com/appsody/stacks.git\ncd stacks/samples/sample-stack\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>You now have the basic <a href=\"/docs/stacks/stack-structure\">structure</a> of a stack ready to create an Appsody stack.</p>\n<h2>Creating the stack image</h2>\n<p>The stack image contains everything that will be common throughout all templates that leverage it. For example, the <a href=\"https://github.com/appsody/stacks/tree/master/incubator/nodejs-express/image\"><code>nodejs-express</code></a> stack image provides health endpoints and prometheus metrics without developers needing to implement it themselves.</p>\n<p>The <code>/image</code> directory will contain everything that is needed for the stack's image. You <strong>must</strong> include a <code>Dockerfile-stack</code> file in the <code>/image</code> directory, which defines how the stack image is built.</p>\n<p>Stack creators configure <a href=\"/docs/stacks/environment-variables\">environment variables</a> in <code>Dockerfile-stack</code> to specify the behaviour they expect from the stack throughout the application development lifecycle. <code>Appsody CLI</code> and <code>Appsody controller</code> inspect these environment variables and then drive the expected behaviour for the developer.</p>\n<p>If a stack image is built upon another stack's image, it will inherit all the Appsody variables from the base stack. It can override the variables it wants to change. This allows users to create stacks with slightly different behaviour while still getting updates from the base stack.</p>\n<p>The <code>/image/project</code> directory contains the base of the application. You may decide not to include any application code here but it is recommended to add some value to the stack. For example, by controlling dependency versions. The <code>project</code> <strong>must</strong> include a production <code>Dockerfile</code> here which will be used by the <a href=\"/docs/using-appsody/cli-commands/#appsody-build\"><code>appsody build</code></a> command.</p>\n<h2>Creating a template</h2>\n<p>Templates provide an initial application to enable developers to get started with a stack. They provide a starter application that a developer can expand and adapt as they require.</p>\n<p>All templates should be created within <code>/templates</code>. Every template is contained within its own directory, <code>/templates/&#x3C;template-name></code>.</p>\n<p>If the stack is intended to be contributed to the  <a href=\"https://github.com/appsody/stacks\">Appsody stacks repository</a> the stack image should be called <code>appsody/&#x3C;stack-name>:&#x3C;stack-version></code>.</p>\n<h2>Building and testing stacks locally</h2>\n<p>Now that have you have created a stack you can <a href=\"/docs/stacks/build-and-test\">build and test</a> it locally.</p>\n<h2>Contributing a stack</h2>\n<p>If you would like to contribute a new stack to the <a href=\"https://github.com/appsody/stacks\">stacks repository</a> the Appsody <a href=\"https://github.com/appsody/website/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\">contributing guildlines</a> explains how.</p>\n<p>We welcome new contributions but before starting a large piece of work we recommend to reach out to us on <a href=\"http://appsody-slack.eu-gb.mybluemix.net/\">slack</a> or <a href=\"https://github.com/appsody/stacks/issues/\">raise an issue</a> to start a discussion.</p>\n<h2>Maintaining a separate repository</h2>\n<p>In addition to the main Appsody stacks repository, you can maintain your own set of stacks. This is useful for developing stacks and separating sets of stacks for different uses.</p>\n<p>By default you have access to the <code>appsodyhub</code> repository:</p>\n<pre><code>$ appsody repo list\nNAME            URL                                                               \n*appsodyhub     https://github.com/appsody/stacks/releases/latest/download/incubator-index.yaml  \nexperimental    https://github.com/appsody/stacks/releases/latest/download/experimental-index.yaml\n</code></pre>\n<p>A repository is defined by an <code>index.yaml</code>. This file lists all stacks and  templates it wants to make avalible.  See the <code>appsodyhub</code> <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/appsody/stacks/master/index.yaml\">index</a> as an example.</p>\n<p>Each template section must include a link to its <code>.tar.gz</code> file. This will be used by <code>appsody init</code> to initialize a Appsody project.</p>\n<p>You can add you repository by running:</p>\n<pre><code>appsody repo add &#x3C;name> &#x3C;index-url>\n</code></pre>\n<p>For example:</p>\n<pre><code>appsody repo add my-repo file:///Users/foo/index.yaml\n\nappsody repo list\nNAME           URL                                                               \n*appsodyhub    https://github.com/appsody/stacks/releases/latest/download/incubator-index.yaml\nexperimental   https://github.com/appsody/stacks/releases/latest/download/experimental-index.yaml\nmy-repo        file:///Users/foo/index.yaml\n</code></pre>\n<p>Once the repository has been added you can access the stacks in that repo by specifying the repository name when initializing your project:</p>\n<pre><code>appsody init my-repo/&#x3C;stack-name>\n</code></pre>","frontmatter":{"path":"/docs/stacks/create","title":"Creating a Stack"}}},{"node":{"html":"<h1>Building and Testing Stacks</h1>\n<p>The instructions below will reference the \"base directory\", which will be the directory containing the clone or copy of the appsody/stacks git repository.</p>\n<p>Once you have created or updated a stack, use scripts in the <code>ci/</code> directory to build stack images and templates, and to generate an appsody repository index you can use for local testing. The script <code>./ci/build.sh</code> combines several operations (lint, prefetch, package, test) for the specified stack. If you would like to learn more about the process for building, testing and releasing a stack, please see <a href=\"https://github.com/appsody/stacks/blob/master/RELEASE.md#appsody-stacks-release-process---technical-overview\">Appsody Stacks Release Process</a>.</p>\n<h2>Building a stack locally using build scripts</h2>\n<p>From the base directory:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Run the build script and specify the desired stack as a parameter, for example:</p>\n<pre><code>./ci/build.sh . incubator/nodejs-express\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> If a stack is not specified, all stacks in all repositories will be built.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Add the generated appsody repository to the repository list:</p>\n<pre><code>appsody repo add &#x3C;local-repo-name> file://$PWD/ci/assets/&#x3C;local-stack-repo>\n</code></pre>\n<p>The value of <code>&#x3C;local-stack-repo></code> can be <code>incubator-index-local.yaml</code> or <code>experimental-index-local.yaml</code> or <code>stable-index-local.yaml</code>. For example:</p>\n<pre><code>appsody repo add my-repo-incubator file://$PWD/ci/assets/incubator-index-local.yaml\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Check the built stack has been added in that repository by running <code>appsody list my-repo-incubator</code>.

However, you can also configure an existing source code project to use an appropriate Appsody stack.  </p>\n<h2>Creating a new project</h2>\n<p>The first step to creating a new project is to create an empty directory and give your project a name. You might want to place the project directory next to your other source code projects or your IDE workspace. For example:</p>\n<pre><code>cd /path/to/your/project/workspace\nmkdir my-project\ncd my-project\n</code></pre>\n<p>Alternatively, you could clone an empty git repository or create an empty project in an IDE, then navigate to that directory in the terminal. Appsody is tolerant of some hidden files in the project directory, such as .git, .project, or .settings files. The <code>appsody init &#x3C;repo>/&#x3C;stack> &#x3C;template></code> command won't overwrite files without the <code>--overwrite</code> option.</p>\n<p>Next, choose a stack.

As such, a stack is designed to support two ways of working:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Rapid Local Development Mode</strong><br>\nIn this mode, the stack provides everything to enable the development of a new application on the local machine, with the application <em>always</em> being run in a (local) containerized Docker environment. The fact that application development uses containerization from the start (as opposed to development solely in the user space of the local machine) minimizes the chances of introducing subtle issues in the containerization process, and removes the need for a developer to install the core technology components that will underpin their application. The requirements on the stack, therefore, are to have all the dependencies for the particular technologies involved pre-built into the Docker image, and also to dynamically compliment these with whatever dependencies are added explicitly by the developer for their code. Rapid local development mode consists of the appsody CLI (hooked into a local IDE if required), communicating with a local Docker container that is running the application under development. Furthermore, local development is accelerated by enabling application code to be held on the local file system, whilst being mounted in the Docker container, so that a local change can automatically trigger a restart of the application.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Build and Deploy Mode</strong><br>\nIn this mode, the stack enables the appsody CLI to build a self-contained Docker image that includes both the core technologies in the stack plus the application code that has been developed, along with the combined dependencies of both. The resulting image can then be deployed manually or programatically to any platform that supports Docker images (such as a local or public Kubernetes cluster).</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Stack structure</h2>\n<p>Given the fact that a single stack is designed to enable both the above methods of working (under the control of the Appsody software), there is a standard structure that all stacks follow. The structure below represents the source structure of a stack:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">my-stack\n├── README.md\n├── stack.yaml\n├── image/\n|   ├── config/\n|   |   └── app-deploy.yaml\n|   ├── project/\n|   |   ├── [files that provide the technology components of the stack]\n|   |   └── Dockerfile\n│   ├── Dockerfile-stack\n|   └── LICENSE\n└── templates/\n    ├── my-template-1/\n    |       └── [example files as a starter for the application, e.g. \"hello world\"]\n    └── my-template-2/\n            └── [example files as a starter for a more complex application]\n</code></pre>\n<p>The structure above is then processed when you build a stack, to generate a Docker image for the stack, along with tar files of each of the templates, which can then all be stored/referenced in a local or public appsody repo. Refer to the section on <a href=\"/docs/stacks/build-and-test.md\">Building and Testing Stacks</a> for more details. The appsody CLI can then access such a repo, to use the stack to initiate local development.</p>\n<p>As described in the first section, the stack (in conjunction with the Appsody software) has different responsibilities, depending on which mode of operation is being carried out. To understand how the stack operates, we will delve into each of these scenarios separately, including the initial work required to initialize the project. One of things that can initially cause confusion when looking at the source of an appsody stack is that there are two Docker files. These are independant of each other - one is used to build the initial stack image (<code>Dockerfile-stack</code>) and one to build the final application image (<code>Dockerfile</code>). These are both described as we examine the scenarios.</p>\n<h2>Stack requirements during 'Initialization' mode</h2>\n<p>This mode is triggered by a user issuing an <code>appsody init</code> command in a new empty directory, in order to configure a new project. It might seem odd that there are any requirements on the stack for initialization, but since the goal is for the stack image to encapsulate <em>all</em> aspects of the stack, the configuration steps required (which are likely to be technology specific) are indeed contained within it. The following is a summary of what happens during initialization:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Appsody CLI finds the yaml entry for the stack in the respective repo</li>\n<li>Appsody CLI downloads the referenced tar file for the specified template to be used as a basis for the user application, and extracts the contents. This creates the directory structure within the current directory, including the <code>.appsody-config.yaml</code> file that specifies the stack image itself (which is usually stored in a Docker repository)</li>\n<li>Appsody CLI downloads this stack image</li>\n<li>Appsody CLI inspects the stack image to see if it has an initialization file within it called <code>appsody-init.sh</code> (or <code>appsody-init.bat</code> if running on Windows). If this file does it exist, it is executed to set up any further configuration. Note that it not recommended that this initialization installs new packages or modules in user space of the local machine. Any dependencies should be handled by ensuring this happens during the run and build modes, listed below.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Stack operation during 'Rapid Local Development' mode</h2>\n<p>In this mode, when the stack image is run, it must build the appropriate local container runtime configuration. This will include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Mounting into the image, the directories from the user space of the local machine that contains the user application, as well as the appsody controller and any dependencies</li>\n<li>Enabling the software dependencies defined by the image</li>\n<li>Setting up any environment variables required</li>\n<li>Passing control to the appsody controller with a command to execute (e.g. <code>run</code>), which the controller will action, and then wait for further commands to be sent to it from the appsody CLI</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You will note that in Rapid Local Development mode, Docker does not run the user application on startup - it is the appsody controller that is in charge (and will execute the user application when required). The above is achieved with settings in the Docker file for the stack itself (<code>Dockerfile-stack</code>), which are now described.</p>\n<h3>Mounting the correct directories into the image</h3>\n<p>There are three types of volume/mounts used by appsody:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Volume mounts specified in the <code>APPSODY_MOUNTS</code> Docker variable<br>\nThese will be processed by the appsody CLI. The primary use of this is to mount the directory holding the user application into the container, so that the appsody-controller can have access to your application (and run it inside the container). For example:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">ENV APPSODY_MOUNTS=/:/project/userapp\n</code></pre>\n<p>   would map the current directory (where the init was performed), into <code>/project/userapp</code> in the container file system.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Dependency directory volume<br>\nThis creates a volume used to cache, for efficiency, the combined dependencies of the stack components and the user application between sequential runs of the application in rapid local development mode. It is not mounted into the user directory, since access to this is not required outside of the Docker environment. This is simply specified via the Docker variable <code>APPSODY_DEPS</code>. For example:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">ENV APPSODY_DEPS=/project/deps\n</code></pre>\n<p>   would cause the creation of a volume to be created and mounted into the container file systems at <code>/project/deps</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Appsody controller mount<br>\nThe appsody CLI will create this automatically, first checking you have the latest appsody-controller downloaded into the user file system (by default at <code>~/.appsody/appsody-controller</code>), and then mounting this into <code>/appsody/appsody-controller</code> in the container file system. The reason this approach is taken is so that stack images do not need to be updated simply to ensure the latest version of the appsody-controller will be used.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Enabling the software dependencies</h3>\n<p>There are two types of dependencies that need to be handled by the stack.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Dependencies required for the technology components included in the stack<br>\nFor efficiency, these only need to be installed when the image is launched. Hence, these are typically encoded as regular Docker commands. For example, in the python-flask stack, these dependencies are defined in a <code>Pipfile</code> in the <code>image/project</code> directory, and are processed by the following Docker commands:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">RUN pipenv lock -r > requirements.txt\nRUN python -m pip install -r requirements.txt -t /project/deps\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Dependencies added by the developer for their application<br>\nSince the developer might add these at any stage, these are generated each time an appsody command is executed by the controller. This is achieved by setting the <code>ENV APPSODY_PREP</code> Docker variable, which the appsody controller will execute. For example, again in the python-flask stack, these dependencies are defined in the user directory (created by the template) and are referenced by:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">ENV APPSODY_PREP=\"cd /project/userapp; pipenv lock -r > requirements.txt; python -m pip install -r requirements.txt -t /project/deps\"\n</code></pre>\n<p>   [Note that in older stacks this variable was called <code>APPSODY_INSTALL</code>, which has since been deprecated]</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Setting up any environment variables required</h3>\n<p>Any environment variables required by the technology in the stack itself are typically set in the <code>Dockerfile-stack</code> file, using the regular Docker <code>ENV</code> command.</p>\n<h3>Passing control to the appsody controller to run the user application</h3>\n<p>When an <code>appsody run</code> command is issued, the stack image is launched in the local Docker environment of the user machine and the appsody-controller is set as the entrypoint. The controller is also passed the appsody command being executed (<code>run</code> in this case). The appsody controller will then process the appsody-specifc Docker variables to manage how the user application is run and managed. These appsody-specific variables are described in full in the section <a href=\"/docs/stacks/environment-variables.md\">Appsody Environment Variables</a>, although the most important ones for the run case are (with examples from the python-flask stack):</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">ENV APPSODY_RUN=\"python -m flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=8080\"\n</code></pre>\n<p>which specifies the command to be run by the appsody controller to start the user application, and:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">ENV APPSODY_WATCH_DIR=/project/userapp\n</code></pre>\n<p>which specifies the directory for the appsody controller to watch for changes, so that the user application can be automatically re-launched for rapid local development. Since re-launching may require addition steps, the variable <code>APPSODY_RUN_ON_CHANGE</code> specifies the command that will be run to re-launch the application.</p>\n<p>The appsody controller remains running throughout rapid local development mode, and is terminated with the <code>appsody stop</code> command (or simply killing the running appsody CLI process).</p>\n<h2>Stack operation during 'Build and Deploy' mode</h2>\n<p>The build mode is designed to package up both the new user application and the technology components of the stack into a single Docker image that can be deployed and run in any Docker environment (often a local or public kubernetes cluster). From a stack point of view, the key requirement is to include a Docker file which will build this combined image. This is the <code>Dockerfile</code> in the <code>project</code> directory in the stack source (as opposed to the <code>Dockerfile-stack</code> file in the <code>image</code> directory which is used when you are creating the original stack image).</p>\n<p>The steps undertaken when the <code>appsody build</code> command is run are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Appsody CLI extracts the contents of the stack into a local directory (by default <code>~/.appsody/extract</code>) along with the user application.</li>\n<li>Appsody CLI then runs, effectively, a Docker build using the <code>Dockerfile</code> in the <code>project</code> directory of this extracted structure, resulting in a Docker image for the combined application.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The <code>Dockerfile</code> needs to build the dependencies for both the stack technology components as well as the user application, and set the entrypoint (or <code>CMD</code>) to an appropriate entrypoint for the user application. The appsody controller is not involved in the final application image.</p>\n<h2>Summary of files within the stack source and user directory structure</h2>\n<h3>Stack.yaml</h3>\n<p>The <code>stack.yaml</code> file in the top level directory defines the different attributes of the stack and which template the stack should use by default. See the example below:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">name: Sample Application Stack   # concise one line name for the stack\nversion: 0.1.0                   # version of the stack\ndescription: sample stack to help creation of more appsody stacks # free form text explaining more about the capabilities of this stack and various templates\nlicense: Apache-2.0              # license for the stack\nlanguage: nodejs                 # programming language the stack uses\nmaintainers:                     # list of maintainer(s) details\n  - name: John Smith\n    email: example@example.com\n    github-id: jsmith\ndefault-template: my-template-1  # name of default template\n</code></pre>\n<h3>README</h3>\n<p>The top level directory must contain a <code>README.md</code> markdown file that describes the contents of the stack and how it should be used.</p>\n<h3>LICENSE</h3>\n<p>The <code>image</code> directory must contain a <code>LICENSE</code> file.</p>\n<h3>app-deploy.yaml</h3>\n<p>The <code>app-deploy.yaml</code> is the configuration file for deploying an Appsody project using the Appsody Operator. For more information about specifics, see <a href=\"https://github.com/appsody/appsody-operator/blob/master/doc/user-guide.md\">Appsody Operator User Guide</a>.</p>\n<h3>Dockerfile-stack</h3>\n<p>The <code>Dockerfile-stack</code> file in the <code>image</code> directory defines the foundation stack image, and a set of environment variables that specify the desired behaviour during the rapid local development cycle. It also defines what is exposed from the host machine to the container during this mode.</p>\n<p>Environment variables can be set to alter the behaviour of the CLI and controller (see <a href=\"/docs/stacks/environment-variables.md\">Appsody Environment Variables</a>).</p>\n<h3>Dockerfile</h3>\n<p>The <code>Dockerfile</code> in the <code>image/project</code> directory defines the final image that will created by the <code>appsody build</code> command, which needs to contain the content from both the stack itself along with the user application (typically modified from one of the templates). This is used to run the application as a whole, outside of appsody CLI control.</p>\n<h3>Templates</h3>\n<p>A template is a pre-configured starter application that is ready to use with the particular stack image. It has access to all the dependencies supplied by that image and is able to include new functionality and extra dependencies to enhance the image. A stack can have multiple templates, perhaps representing different classes of starter applications using the stack technology components.</p>\n<h3>.appsody-config.yaml</h3>\n<p>The <code>.appsody-config.yaml</code> is not part of the the source structure, but will be generated as part of the stack building process, and will be placed in the user directory by the <code>appsody init</code>, command. This file specifies the stack image that will be used, and can be overridden for testing purposes to a locally built stack.</p>\n<p>For example, the following specifies that the template will use the python-flask image:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">stack: python-flask:0.1\n</code></pre>","frontmatter":{"path":"/docs/stacks/stack-structure","title":"Stack structure and requirements"}}},{"node":{"html":"<h1>Installing Appsody</h1>\n<p>You can install Appsody on your system in a few easy steps by using our binary packages, which are available for macOS®, Ubuntu, Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), and Windows®.</p>\n<p>Because Appsody depends on Docker, ensure that you have <a href=\"https://docs.docker.com/get-started/\">Docker</a> installed and the Docker daemon running on your system.</p>\n<h2>Installing on macOS</h2>\n<p>Follow these steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>If you don't have the Xcode command line tools installed on your system, install them by running <code>xcode-select --install</code>.</li>\n<li>If you don't have Homebrew installed on your system, install it by running <code>/usr/bin/ruby -e \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)\"</code>.</li>\n<li>To install Appsody, run:</li>\n</ol>\n<pre><code>brew install appsody/appsody/appsody\n</code></pre>\n<p>This command creates a brew tap for the <code>appsody/appsody</code> repo and installs the <code>appsody</code> formula.</p>\n<p>That's all there is to it!

Also, if your project directory includes underscore characters, those will be converted to dashes (-), because certain areas of Kubernetes are not tolerant of underscore characters.</p>\n<p>Here is an example of the output produced by the <code>appsody build</code> command on a project named <code>appsody-project</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>micheles-mbp:appsody-project mchilant$ appsody build\nExtracting project from development environment\nRunning command: docker[pull appsody/nodejs:0.2]\nRunning command: docker[run --rm --name appsody-project-extract --entrypoint /bin/bash appsody/nodejs:0.2 -c if [ -f /project/Dockerfile ]; then echo \"/project/Dockerfile\"; else find / -type f -name Dockerfile; fi]\nRunning command: docker[create --name appsody-project-extract -v /Users/mchilant/appsody-project/:/project/user-app appsody/nodejs:0.2]\nRunning command: docker[cp appsody-project-extract:/project /Users/mchilant/.appsody/extract/appsody-project]\nRunning command: docker[rm appsody-project-extract -f]\nProject extracted to /Users/mchilant/.appsody/extract/appsody-project\nRunning command: docker[build -t appsody-project -f /Users/mchilant/.appsody/extract/appsody-project/Dockerfile /Users/mchilant/.appsody/extract/appsody-project]\nBuilt docker image appsody-project\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Deploying your app directly to a Kubernetes cluster</h2>\n<p>There are many options to deploy your Appsody applications to a Kubernetes cluster. The best approach depends on the specific scenario:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you are testing your app on a locally installed cluster, using <code>appsody deploy</code> is your best bet</li>\n<li>If you intend to have your app deployed on a shared cluster for integration testing or production, you are probably going to rely on CI/CD pipelines, and have the app built and deployed from its source.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The <code>appsody deploy</code> command provides a way for you to deploy your application directly to a Kubernetes cluster. The deployment may occur in one of two different ways, depending on how the stack you are using is configured:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If the stack contains a deployment manifest that can be consumed by the <a href=\"https://operatorhub.io/operator/appsody-operator\">Appsody operator</a>, <code>appsody deploy</code> will install the operator, if necessary, and deploy your application to the cluster using that deployment manifest.</li>\n<li>If the stack you are using is not equipped with the manifest for the Appsody operator, <code>appsody deploy</code> attempts to install your app as a Knative serving service.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Deployment via the Appsody Operator - Overview</h3>\n<p>Kubernetes operators offer a powerful way to provide full lifecycle maintenance of a wide range of resources on Kubernetes clusters. In particular, they can install, upgrade, remove, and monitor application deployments. The recently published <a href=\"https://operatorhub.io/operator/appsody-operator\">Appsody operator</a> automates the installation and maintenance of a special type of Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs), called <strong>AppsodyApplication</strong>. </p>\n<p>The Appsody stacks that are currently available include a template of such a CRD manifest. When you run <code>appsody deploy</code> on a project created from one of the stacks enabled with those manifests, the CLI customizes the manifest with information that is specific to the deployment (such as namespace and project name), and submits the manifest to the Appsody operator on the Kubernetes cluster.</p>\n<p>In fact, if your cluster does not already provide an operator, <code>appsody deploy</code> will install one for you. You can also use the Appsody CLI to install an instance of the Appsody operator, without installing any applications. This can be achieved by running the <code>appsody operator install</code> command.\nLet's discuss some of the details behind the <code>appsody deploy</code> and <code>appsody operator</code> commands. </p>\n<h4>How the Appsody operator works</h4>\n<p>Before we delve into the details of <code>appsody deploy</code> and <code>appsody operator</code>, we need to spend a few words on how the Appsody operator works.</p>\n<p>An operator monitors certain resources - it can detect when resource definition instances are added, removed, or changed, and take the appropriate action. </p>\n<p>The Appsody operator monitors instances of the <strong>AppsodyApplication</strong> resource. It does so by \"watching\" a certain namespace, which is defined when the Appsody operator is installed. The operator can watch a single namespace, or all the namespaces in the cluster.</p>\n<p>The operator itself, however, can be installed in its own namespace, which not necessarily coincides with the namespace it is watching. You can have an Appsody operator in namespace \"abc\" watching namespace \"xyz\". </p>\n<p>You can also have multiple Appsody operators in a cluster, but only one operator can watch a certain namespace. Also, only one operator can be installed in any given namespace.</p>\n<p>Lastly, if you have an Appsody operator that watches the entire cluster, that can be the only Appsody operator in the cluster.</p>\n<h4>Using <code>appsody deploy</code> with the Appsody operator</h4>\n<p>When you run <code>appsody deploy</code> on a project that is based on a stack that is enabled for the Appsody operator, this command will do the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It will check whether there is an Appsody operator in the target namespace that watches that same namespace</li>\n<li>If there isn't one, it attempts to install it. If there's already an operator, the command will move to the next step.</li>\n<li>The command will then proceed to install the AppsodyApplication (your app)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The command can be run with or without a <code>--namespace</code> or <code>-n</code> flag. No flag means you are targeting the <code>default</code> namespace.</p>\n<p>When you want to remove your application, you can run: </p>\n<pre><code>appsody deploy delete\n</code></pre>\n<p>This command must be run from your Appsody project directory. It will attempt to remove the application you installed, but it will not touch the Appsody operator.</p>\n<h4>Using the <code>appsody operator</code> commands</h4>\n<p>In certain cases, you may want to deploy one or more Appsody operators on your cluster ahead of time, and let developers deploy their applications to the cluster without them having to meddle with operator deployments.</p>\n<p>The <code>appsody operator</code> commands can be used to install or uninstall those operators. They take this form:</p>\n<pre><code>appsody operator install --namespace &#x3C;operator namespace> --watchspace &#x3C;watched namespace>\nappsody operator uninstall --namespace &#x3C;operator namespace>\n</code></pre>\n<p>The first command attempts to install an Appsody operator in <code>operator namespace</code>, watching the <code>watched namespace</code>. If the <code>--watchspace</code> flag is omitted, the watched namespace will default to the operator namespace. If both flags are omitted, both namespaces will be assumed to be the <code>default</code> namespace.</p>\n<p>The second command attempts to remove the Appsody operator installed in the <code>operator namespace</code>, if there is one. When you run that command, the Appsody CLI will check whether there are Appsody applications that are present in the watched namespace associated with that operator. If there are any, the command will take no action and produce a message that suggests using the <code>--force</code> flag to force the removal of the apps, as shown below:</p>\n<pre><code>appsody operator uninstall --namespace &#x3C;operator namespace> --force\n</code></pre>\n<p>You can also install an Appsody operator that watches the entire cluster, using the following command:</p>\n<pre><code>appsody operator install --namespace &#x3C;operator namespace> --watch-all\n</code></pre>\n<h4>RBAC considerations for the use of <code>appsody deploy</code> and <code>appsody operator</code> commands</h4>\n<p>The <code>appsody deploy</code> and <code>appsody operator</code> commands involve the lookup and creation of a number of different resources, both in specific namespaces and at the cluster level. </p>\n<p>In a typical local testing scenario, developers have full administrative rights on the entire cluster. In that case, no specific provisions need to be made in terms of granting permissions.</p>\n<p>However, if a single cluster is shared across many development groups, it is common practice to restrict full access to resources by limiting it to a single namespace. An individual developer or a group of developers would have the ability to create, modify, and delete resources only in a certain namespace. </p>\n<p>The use of <code>appsody deploy</code> and <code>appsody operator</code> commands, however, requires granting the following permissions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Querying Appsody operator instances across namespaces</li>\n<li>Creating the <code>AppsodyApplication</code> CRDs</li>\n<li>Querying <code>RoleBindings</code> across namespaces</li>\n<li>Creating instances of the Appsody operator in a namespace</li>\n<li>Full access to resources in the watched namespace of the operator, if different from the namespace where the operator is installed</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In a shared cluster scenario, with developers limited to access their own namespace, we expect the most common pattern of usage will be the following:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Developers can use <code>appsody deploy -n &#x3C;namespace></code> to target their own namespace. The first time <code>appsody deploy</code> is used, the operator is installed and it watches the namespace of choice.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Only cluster administrators can use <code>appsody operator install -n &#x3C;namespace> --watchspace &#x3C;another namespace></code> to enable operators to watch across namespaces. </p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Under these assumptions, developers need to be granted the following permissions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>First, through a Role: </li>\n</ol>\n<pre><code>kind: Role\napiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1\nmetadata:\n  name: $NAMESPACE-user-full-access\n  namespace: $NAMESPACE\nrules:\n- apiGroups: [\"\", \"extensions\", \"apps\", \"autoscaling\", \"appsody.dev\", \"rbac.authorization.k8s.io\"]\n  resources: [\"*\"]\n  verbs: [\"*\"]\n- apiGroups: [\"batch\"]\n  resources:\n  - jobs\n  - cronjobs\n  verbs: [\"*\"]\n</code></pre>\n<p>This role grants full access to resources in a certain namespace (substitute the <code>$NAMESPACE</code> placeholder with the namespace name), including the Appsody operator resources.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Second, through a ClusterRole:</li>\n</ol>\n<pre><code>kind: ClusterRole\napiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1\nmetadata:\n  name: $NAMESPACE-user-node-readonly-access\nrules:\n- apiGroups: [\"\", \"apps\", \"autoscaling\", \"extensions\"]\n  resources: [\"*\"]\n  verbs: [\"get\", \"watch\", \"list\"]\n- apiGroups: [\"apiextensions.k8s.io\"]\n  resources: [\"customresourcedefinitions\"]\n  verbs: [\"*\"]\n- apiGroups: [\"rbac.authorization.k8s.io\"]\n  resources: [\"rolebindings\"]\n  verbs: [\"get\", \"watch\", \"list\"]  \n</code></pre>\n<p>  This ClusterRole allows users to lookup the necessary resources across namespaces, and to create CRDs anywhere in the cluster (which is required by the installation of the operator, in certain cases).</p>\n<p>  Once you have these roles in place, you need to create the appropriate RoleBinding and ClusterRoleBinding to bind your users or groups to them.</p>\n<h3>Deployment as a Knative Service</h3>\n<p>If the stack you are using for your Appsody project does not support the Appsody operator, <code>appsody deploy</code> will default to deploying your app as a Knative serving service.</p>\n<p>In this case, the following <strong>pre-requisites</strong> apply:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You must have access to a Kubernetes cluster, with Knative Serving installed and running. To install Knative locally, use the Kubernetes feature in Docker for Desktop, see <a href=\"/docs/using-appsody/installing-knative-locally.md\">Installing Knative Locally</a>. To install Knative on other Kubernetes clusters, see the <a href=\"https://knative.dev/docs/install/\">Knative Install Documentation</a>.</li>\n<li>You must configure your <code>kubectl</code> CLI to point to your Kubernetes cluster.</li>\n<li>If you intend to push the Docker image containing your application to Docker Hub, your target cluster must be configured to pull images from Docker Hub.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Using the createKnativeService option to deploy as a Knative Service</h4>\n<p>The appsody operator allows you to deploy as a Knative Service if your stack contains a config/app-deploy.yaml file. You can add the element <code>createKnativeService: true</code> to your <code>app-deploy.yaml</code> file in your project directory.</p>\n<p>Perform the following steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><code>appsody deploy —generate-only</code> will create <code>app-deploy.yaml</code> for your project</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Edit your app-deploy.yaml file.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Add the line <code>createKnativeService: true</code> in the spec definition section to the <code>app-deploy.yaml</code> file created above, </li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Deploy your application:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>For Local Docker:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Run the command <code>appsody deploy —-tag dev.local/&#x3C;projectName> --namespace your-namespace</code></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Tagging with  <code>dev.local/</code> makes the image accessible to your Kubernetes cluster.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>For Docker Hub:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Run the command <code>appsody deploy --push -—tag my-account/&#x3C;projectName> --namespace your-namespace</code>\nNotes:</li>\n<li>The --tag option tags the image.</li>\n<li>You must be logged in to your docker repo for --push to work. </li>\n<li>The --push  flag tells the appsody CLI to push the image to Docker Hub</li>\n<li>You must be logged in to Docker Hub for --push to work. </li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The Knative Service should now be operable at the URL specified in the output.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Deploying your application to a local Kubernetes cluster</h3>\n<p>If you have installed a Kubernetes cluster on your development workstation and want to use your local Docker image cache instead of pushing the image to Docker Hub, make sure you set up your Kubernetes cluster to consume images from the local Docker cache.</p>\n<p>To deploy your Appsody project locally, run:</p>\n<pre><code>appsody deploy\n</code></pre>\n<p>This command completes the following actions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Calls <code>appsody build</code> and creates a <em>deployment</em> Docker image, as described in the previous section.</li>\n<li>Tags the image with the special prefix <code>dev.local</code>, making it accessible to your Kubernetes cluster.</li>\n<li>Creates a deployment manifest file named <code>app-deploy.yaml</code>, in a <code>/deploy</code> subdirectory of the project directory. This yaml file is used to issue a <code>kubectl apply -f</code> command against the target Kubernetes cluster. The format of this yaml file depends on whether or not the stack you are using is enabled for the Appsody operator.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Deploying your application through Docker Hub</h3>\n<p>If your cluster is configured to pull images from Docker Hub, use the following command to deploy your application:</p>\n<pre><code>appsody deploy -t &#x3C;myaccount/appsody-project> --push --namespace mynamespace\n</code></pre>\n<p>The command completes the following actions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Calls <code>appsody build</code> and creates a deployment image, as described in the previous section.</li>\n<li>The <code>-t myaccount/appsody-project</code> option tags the image.</li>\n<li>The <code>--push</code> flag tells the appsody CLI to push the image to Docker Hub.</li>\n<li>Creates a deployment manifest file named <code>app-deploy.yaml</code>, in a <code>/deploy</code> subdirectory of the project directory. This yaml file is used to issue a <code>kubectl apply -f</code> command against the target Kubernetes cluster. The format of this yaml file depends on whether or not the stack you are using is enabled for the Appsody operator.</li>\n<li>The <code>--namespace mynamespace</code> option provisions the deployment under the <code>mynamespace</code> namespace.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you don't specify <code>--push</code>, the image is available only on your local Docker registry and the target Kubernetes cluster must be configured to have access to your local Docker registry. Additionally, your image will be tagged as  <code>dev.local/&#x3C;project-name></code> and referenced in the deployment manifest.</p>\n<h3>Deploying multiple projects</h3>\n<p>If you are running multiple Appsody projects on your workstation, you can use <code>appsody deploy</code> and <code>appsody operator</code> commands to get them deployed to a Kubernetes cluster. However, make sure that you run these commands one at a time, because those commands create temporary files that might lead to conflicts if created concurrently.</p>\n<h2>Deploying your app through a Tekton pipeline</h2>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> This deployment option is under development</p>\n<p>Most likely, the deployment of apps created with the appsody CLI is going to occur through the invocation of a CI/CD build pipeline.</p>\n<p>As a developer, you develop your app using the appsody CLI, and when you are ready to deploy, you push your code to a repo or create a pull request on GitHub.</p>\n<p>This <a href=\"https://github.com/appsody/tekton-example\">example</a> shows you how to use Tekton pipelines to deploy your app as a Knative Serving service to a Kubernetes cluster.</p>\n<p>The following pre-requisites are required to run the example pipeline:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You must have developed a project with the appsody CLI, and you must have checked your project into a GitHub repository.</li>\n<li>Your Kubernetes cluster must be configured to run Tekton pipelines (see <a href=\"https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/blob/master/docs/install.md\">Installing Tekton Pipelines</a>).</li>\n<li>Your project must include a deployment manifest called <code>app-deploy.yaml</code>, which is a current pre-requisite if you want to run the pipeline with minimal changes. A quick way to obtain such a manifest is to run the <code>appsody deploy --generate-only</code> command, and then check the <code>app-deploy.yaml</code> file into your source code repository.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>More details on running the Tekton pipeline example for Appsody can be found in the repo <a href=\"https://github.com/appsody/tekton-example/blob/master/README.md\">readme file</a></p>","frontmatter":{"path":"/docs/using-appsody/building-and-deploying","title":"Getting ready to deploy your Appsody project"}}},{"node":{"html":"<h1>Appsody CLI</h1>\n<h2>appsody</h2>\n<p>Appsody CLI</p>\n<h3>Synopsis</h3>\n<p>The Appsody command-line tool (CLI) enables the rapid development of cloud native applications.</p>\n<p>Complete documentation is available at <a href=\"https://appsody.dev\">https://appsody.dev</a></p>\n<h3>Options</h3>\n<pre><code>      --config string   config file (default is $HOME/.appsody/.appsody.yaml)\n      --dryrun          Turns on dry run mode\n  -h, --help            help for appsody\n  -v, --verbose         Turns on debug output and logging to a file in $HOME/.appsody/logs\n</code></pre>\n<h3>SEE ALSO</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#appsody-build\">appsody build</a>\t - Locally build a docker image of your appsody project</li>\n<li><a href=\"#appsody-completion\">appsody completion</a>\t - Generates bash tab completions</li>\n<li><a href=\"#appsody-debug\">appsody debug</a>\t - Run the local Appsody environment in debug mode</li>\n<li><a href=\"#appsody-deploy\">appsody deploy</a>\t - Build and deploy your Appsody project to your Kubernetes cluster</li>\n<li><a href=\"#appsody-extract\">appsody extract</a>\t - Extract the stack and your Appsody project to a local directory</li>\n<li><a href=\"#appsody-init\">appsody init</a>\t - Initialize an Appsody project with a stack and template app</li>\n<li><a href=\"#appsody-list\">appsody list</a>\t - List the Appsody stacks available to init</li>\n<li><a href=\"#appsody-operator\">appsody operator</a>\t - Install or uninstall the Appsody operator from your Kubernetes cluster.</li>\n<li><a href=\"#appsody-ps\">appsody ps</a>\t - List the appsody containers running in the local docker environment</li>\n<li><a href=\"#appsody-repo\">appsody repo</a>\t - Manage your Appsody repositories</li>\n<li><a href=\"#appsody-run\">appsody run</a>\t - Run the local Appsody environment for your project</li>\n<li><a href=\"#appsody-stop\">appsody stop</a>\t - Stops the local Appsody docker container for your project</li>\n<li><a href=\"#appsody-test\">appsody test</a>\t - Test your project in the local Appsody environment</li>\n<li><a href=\"#appsody-version\">appsody version</a>\t - Show Appsody CLI version</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>appsody build</h2>\n<p>Locally build a docker image of your appsody project</p>\n<h3>Synopsis</h3>\n<p>This allows you to build a local Docker image from your Appsody project.
